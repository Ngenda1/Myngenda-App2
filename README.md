# Myngenda Complete Authentication Solution

This package provides a complete authentication solution for Myngenda that works reliably across all browsers. It resolves issues with users being logged out or unable to log in from external browsers.

## What's Included

### Core Files
- `public/standalone-auth.js` - The main authentication system that handles login, registration, and session management
- `public/dashboard-protection.js` - Script to protect dashboard pages and redirect unauthenticated users

### HTML Templates
- `public/index.html` - Landing page with authentication check
- `public/login.html` - Login page with improved error handling
- `public/register.html` - Registration page with form validation
- `public/admin/dashboard-example.html` - Example of a protected admin dashboard

## How to Implement

### Step 1: Upload Files to GitHub
1. Upload all files in this package to your GitHub repository, maintaining the same directory structure

### Step 2: Update Additional HTML Files
For any other HTML files not included in this package, add these two script tags before the closing body tag:

```html
<!-- Authentication System -->
<script src="/standalone-auth.js"></script>

<!-- Dashboard Protection (only for dashboard pages) -->
<script src="/dashboard-protection.js"></script>
```

## How It Works

This solution:
1. Uses localStorage for reliable authentication state storage
2. Implements token-based authentication that works across all browsers
3. Automatically protects dashboard pages from unauthorized access
4. Handles automatic redirection to appropriate dashboards based on user roles

## Testing the Solution

After implementing:
1. Clear your browser cache and cookies
2. Try registering a new user
3. Log out and log back in with the same credentials
4. Verify you can access the appropriate dashboard based on your role

## Debugging

Add `?debug=true` to any page URL to see detailed authentication information in the browser console.

## Technical Support

If you encounter any issues with this implementation, check the browser console for error messages and verify that the standalone-auth.js file is being loaded correctly.
