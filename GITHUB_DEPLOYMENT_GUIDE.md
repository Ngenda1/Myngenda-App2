# MyNgenda GitHub Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your MyNgenda application to Netlify using GitHub.

## Prerequisites

1. A GitHub account
2. A Netlify account (free tier is sufficient)

## Step 1: Upload Files to GitHub

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Upload all the files from this package to your repository
3. Make sure to maintain the directory structure

## Step 2: Connect to Netlify

1. Log in to your Netlify account
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Choose GitHub as your Git provider
4. Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account
5. Select your MyNgenda repository

## Step 3: Configure Netlify Settings

1. Set the build command to: `npm run build` (leave empty if you don't have a build process)
2. Set the publish directory to: `.` (root directory)
3. Click "Deploy site"

## Step 4: Configure Redirects

Add the following redirects in your Netlify site settings:

1. Go to Site settings > Build & deploy > Redirects
2. Add the following rule:

```
/* /index.html 200
```

This ensures that all routes are handled by your frontend application.

## Step 5: Connecting to Your Backend

The standalone authentication system is already configured to connect to your Replit backend. It will automatically detect if it's running on Netlify and use the correct API URL.

Make sure your Replit backend is running and accessible at `https://myngenda.replit.app`.

## Testing Your Deployment

1. Wait for the deployment to complete
2. Visit your Netlify URL (e.g., `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`)
3. Test the authentication by logging in with:
   - Admin: admin@myngenda.com / admin123
   - User: user@myngenda.com / user123

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with your deployment:

1. Check the Netlify deployment logs
2. Make sure your backend on Replit is running
3. Verify that the correct API URL is being used in the frontend
