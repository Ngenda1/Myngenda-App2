# MyNgenda Netlify Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your MyNgenda delivery service to Netlify using GitHub.

## Step 1: Prepare your GitHub Repository

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (or use an existing one)
2. Upload all the files from the `myngenda-github-package.zip` to your repository
3. Make sure to maintain the directory structure exactly as it is in the package

## Step 2: Connect to Netlify

1. Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) and log in (or sign up if you don't have an account)
2. Click the "New site from Git" button
3. Choose GitHub as your Git provider
4. Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account if prompted
5. Select the repository where you uploaded the MyNgenda files

## Step 3: Configure Build Settings

1. In the "Deploy settings" screen, leave the following settings:
   - Build command: (leave blank)
   - Publish directory: `.` (root directory)
2. Click the "Deploy site" button

## Step 4: Wait for Deployment

1. Netlify will build and deploy your site (usually takes 1-2 minutes)
2. Once complete, Netlify will assign a random subdomain to your site (e.g., `random-name-123456.netlify.app`)
3. You can change this to a custom domain later if desired

## Step 5: Verify Deployment

1. Click on the generated site URL to open your MyNgenda application
2. Test the authentication system:
   - Try logging in with a test account:
     - Admin: admin@myngenda.com / admin123
     - User: user@myngenda.com / user123
   - Try registering a new account
   - Verify you can access the dashboard after login

## Step 6: Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with your deployment:

1. Check the Netlify deployment logs for any errors
2. Verify that all files were uploaded to GitHub correctly
3. Make sure the `_redirects` file is in the root directory of your repository
4. Confirm your Replit backend is running at `https://myngenda.replit.app`

## Next Steps

Once your site is successfully deployed, you can:

1. Set up a custom domain in Netlify's site settings
2. Configure SSL/TLS for secure connections
3. Set up form handling if your application uses forms
4. Configure additional environment variables if needed

Congratulations on deploying your MyNgenda delivery service!
